<h1>List of Resources</h1>
<p>
    Over time, we will put together a carefully curated list of resources with a
    mind for what is most useful and efficient for time-constrained residents. We
    will try to grade the accessibility of the content as "Novice", "Beginner",
    or "Intermediate".

    <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Our definitions of experience</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Novice</td>
        <td>Limited or no prior coding experience</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Beginner</td>
        <td>Some prior coding experience, perhaps in another language (aside
            from Python) or unrelated to Data Science and Deep Learning</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Intermediate</td>
        <td>Basic familiarity with Python for Data Science and Deep Learning</td>
