<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>
    None of this would be possible without the inspiration, comments and support
    of the following people (trying not to leave anyone out, but inevitably will):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dr. Kathy Andriole - our wonderful mentor at the MGH-BWH Center for
        Clinical Data Science</li>
    <li>Dr. Michael Rosenthal - another wonderful mentor via the Brigham &
        Women's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Radiology Departments</li>
    <li>Drs. Glenn Gaviola and Bill Mayo-Smith and the rest of the BWH Radiology
        Residency Leadership - for supporting a new, at times uncertain, endeavor
        with the creation of the BWH-CCDS Data Science Pathway</li>
    <li>Our impressive and inspiring colleagues at the MGH-BWH Center for Clinical Data Science
        - the dream team of software engineers, data scientists, and administrative
        staff who teach us new lessons in data science and humility nearly every day</li>
    <li>...and many more to come...</li>
</ul>
