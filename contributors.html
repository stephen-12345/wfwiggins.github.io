<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>
    None of this would be possible without the inspiration, comments and support
    of the following people (trying not to leave anyone out, but inevitably will):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sarah Parks Wiggins - my extremely patient & supportive wife</li>
    <li>Julian "Ian" Wiggins - my impossibly curious & creative son, who inspires
        me to strive toward being a slightly better version of myself with each
        passing day</li>
    <li>My parents, Tom & Rachel Wiggins - for believing in me and supporting me always</li>
    <li>My brother, Doug Wiggins - for his lifelong friendship and for always
        keeping my ego in-check</li>
    <li>Travis Caton, MD, and Kirti Magudia, MD, PhD - my inspiring & incredibly
        tolerant partners-in-crime (or data science...)</li>
    <li>Kathy Andriole, PhD - our wonderful mentor at the MGH-BWH Center for
        Clinical Data Science</li>
    <li>Michael Rosenthal, MD, PhD - another wonderful mentor via the Brigham &
        Women's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Radiology Departments</li>
    <li>Glenn Gaviola, MD, Bill Mayo-Smith, MD, and the rest of the BWH Radiology
        Residency Leadership - for supporting a new, at times uncertain, endeavor
        with the creation of the BWH-CCDS Data Science Pathway</li>
    <li>Tessa Cook, MD, PhD, and Nabile Safdar, MD, MPH - co-conspirators with Kathy
        for the NIIC, as well as co-mentors for the Society for Imaging Informatics
        in Medicine (SIIM) Resident, Fellow & Doctoral Student (RFDS) Committee</li>
    <li>My 2018-19 BWH Radiology co-residents - for being lab rats as I developed
        this idea and who will, along with countless others, follow in my/our
        footsteps and, hopefully, also contribute to this site to make it better
        than I ever could on my own.</li>
    <li>My impressive colleagues at the MGH-BWH Center for Clinical Data Science
        - the dream team of software engineers, data scientists, and administrative
        staff who teach me new lessons in data science and humility nearly every day</li>
    <li>...and many more to come...</li>
</ul>
