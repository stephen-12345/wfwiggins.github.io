Python is a high-level, object-oriented programming language with easy-to-understand
syntax. The name was inspired by Monty Python. It is the most commonly used
language among data scientists who focus on developing machine learning
applications for medical image analysis and natural language processing.
For this reason, it is the language we will teach on this site.

If you are new to Python, I suggest you start by reviewing the
[Beginner's Guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide).
