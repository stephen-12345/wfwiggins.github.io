# About page

This site is is **_completely_ free** and designed for radiology residents (and fellows)
interested in learning Python for Data Science. It was inspired by my own learning
experience, my experience helping my co-residents, and a desire expressed by a number of
participants in the Fall 2018 session of the [National Imaging Informatics Course](https://sites.google.com/view/imaging-informatics-course/home).

There are numerous sites and tutorials that introduce interested parties to the
tools I'll cover on this site. As I'm not in the business of reinventing the
wheel unnecessarily, I will routinely link/refer to other sites and tutorials,
when appropriate. However, my experience has been that many of these cover a
variety of topics that may not be relevant for people specifically interested in
learning data science techniques for Radiology machine learning research. Thus,
I will also generate some original content and tutorials more germane to this
line of inquiry.

Eventually, I intend to open-source this curriculum so that others with
experience (or even expertise, ha) in this arena may contribute and help make
this better for everyone. That is why this site is hosted via GitHub.

If, at any point, you read something that is unclear or run into insurmountable
errors not alleviated by duly rigorous searching on Google and/or StackOverflow...
then, by all means, please feel free to email me at [wwiggins@bwh.harvard.edu](mailto:wwiggins@bwh.harvard.edu). However, the
more effective (and, let's be honest, *tech savvy*) method would be to
submit an **Issue** on the GitHub repo for this site (click the green button at
the top of the screen, then navigate to the **Issues** tab and gripe away). The
second option requires that you already have or are willing to create an account
on GitHub. As such, either option is acceptable, but my responses to asynchronous
communication methods (e.g. email, texts) are notoriously slow. If you don't
believe me, just ask my wife...

Happy coding!
