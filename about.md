# About page

This site is designed for radiology residents (and fellows) interested in
learning Python for Data Science. It was inspired by my own learning experience,
my experience helping my co-residents, and a desire expressed by a number of
participants in the Fall 2018 session of the [National Imaging Informatics Course](https://sites.google.com/view/imaging-informatics-course/home).

There are numerous sites and tutorials that introduce interested parties to the
tools I'll cover on this site. As I'm not in the business of reinventing the
wheel unnecessarily, I will routinely link/refer to other sites and tutorials,
when appropriate. However, my experience has been that many of these cover a
variety of topics that may not be relevant for people specifically interested in
learning data science techniques for Radiology machine learning research. Thus,
I will also generate some original content and tutorials more germane to this
line of inquiry.

Eventually, I intend to open-source this curriculum so that others with
experience (or even expertise, ha) in this arena may contribute and help make
this better for everyone. That is why this site is hosted via GitHub.
