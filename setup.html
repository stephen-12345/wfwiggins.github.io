  This guide will step you through the process of setting up your development
  environment for using the command line to run programs in Python. The ideal
  <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> to use is a Unix-based system such as
  MacOS or a Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu). For simplicity, I'll assume
  you're using MacOS, as Linux users probably won't need many of these tutorials.
  For users on Windows 7, your "best" bet is <i>probably</i> to install
  <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>, a terminal
  emulator for Windows that provides
  <blockquote cite="https://www.cygwin.com/">a large collection of GNU and Open
    Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution...
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  For users on Windows 10, your best bet is to install the Windows Subsystem
  for Linux (WSL). I recommend selecting the Ubuntu distribution from the
  Windows Store after enabling WSL. (<i>insert link for install guide here</i>)
</p>
<p>
  Cygwin and WSL will afford a similar experience to MacOS, though you may end up
  spending a little more time with Google and Stack Overflow to get certain
  elements of the your <abbr title="development">dev</abbr> environment up and
  running.

  Again, from here on out, we're assuming that you're using MacOS... I'll try
  to add support for WSL as this site evolves. However, I have little experience
  with Cygwin, so you're kind of on your own for now...sorry...
</p>
<p>
  The first thing you should do is install the full version of
  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_blank">Xcode</a>, which is available
  through the App Store. This will ensure that you have the full range of
  command line tools available to you.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've done that, it's time to open up a terminal window. The easiest
  way to do this is to launch the Spotlight app via the keyboard shortcut
  <code>{CMD-SPACE}</code>, then type "terminal", followed by
  <code>{ENTER}</code>.

  If you haven't already, this is the perfect time to head over to the
  <a href="/command-line.html">Command Line</a> page for an introduction to the
  <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> (or "shell").
