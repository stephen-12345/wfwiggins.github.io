<p>
    This guide will step you through the process of setting up your development
  environment for using the command line to run programs in Python. The ideal
  <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> to use is a Unix-based system such as
  MacOS or a Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu). For simplicity, I'll assume
  you're using MacOS, as Linux users probably won't need many of these tutorials.
</p>
<p>
    For users on Windows 10, your best bet is to install the Windows Subsystem
  for Linux (WSL). I recommend selecting the Ubuntu distribution from the
  Windows Store after enabling WSL. (<i>insert link for install guide here</i>)
</p>
<p>
    For users on Windows 7, your "best" bet is <i>probably</i> to install
  <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>, a terminal
  emulator for Windows that provides
  <blockquote cite="https://www.cygwin.com/">a large collection of GNU and Open
    Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution...
  </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  WSL and Cygwin should afford a similar experience to MacOS, though you may end up
  spending a little more time with Google and Stack Overflow to get certain
  elements of the your <abbr title="development">dev</abbr> environment up and
  running.

<p>
  Again, from here on out, we're assuming that you're using MacOS... I'll try
  to add support for WSL as this site evolves. However, I have little experience
  with Cygwin, so you're kind of on your own for now...sorry...
</p>
<p>
  The first thing you should do is install the full version of
  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_blank">Xcode</a>, which is available
  through the App Store. This will ensure that you have the full range of
  command line tools available to you - a necessary step before
  <a href="/advanced-setup.html">Advanced Setup</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've done that, it's time to open up a terminal window. The easiest
  way to do this is to launch the Spotlight app via the keyboard shortcut
  <code>{CMD-SPACE}</code>, then type "terminal", followed by
  <code>{ENTER}</code>.

      If you haven't already, this is the perfect time to head over to the
      <a href="/command-line.html">Command Line</a> page for an introduction to the
      <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> (or "shell").

<h2 id="text-editors">Text Editors</h2>
<p>
    Every programmer has his or her preferred text editor. I use <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. I used to
    use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. I dabble in <code>vim</code> for when I want to quickly edit a config
    file or a shell script without leaving my Terminal. I don't recommend <code>vim</code> to
    beginners. Sublime Text is sorta free and very configurable, but requires a little bit of
    work to get it setup initially. Atom is for-real-free works great out of the box, but is also
    configurable/extensible. I've heard <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> is great (also free), but it doesn't play
    particularly nice with <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr>, so I haven't really bothered to try it out. I'd
    recommend Atom to most beginners. But if you're unconvinced, you should do a
    little research and figure out which text editor might be best for you. Just
    pick a nice one with some simple features like syntax highlighting and it
    will make programming/coding a lot more fun...and efficient.

<h2 id="python">Installing Python with Anaconda</h2>
<p>
    If you plan to do the <a href="/advanced-setup.html">Advanced Setup</a>, now
    is the time to stop and head over there before continuing with these steps.
    If not, feel free to proceed.
</p>
<p>
    Though Python comes preinstalled with recent versions of MacOS, I highly
    recommend using Anaconda (or Miniconda) for managing Python packages and
    virutal environments (more on these later). You could follow
    <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos">this link</a> to download and
    install Anaconda with all of it's bells and whistles. However, since we're
    learning the command line, I recommend you go with
    <a href="https://conda.io/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a>, a lighter-weight
    version without the Spyder <abbr title="Independent Development Environment">IDE</abbr>.
</p>
<p>
    If you go with Miniconda, select the download for Python 3.7 64-bit bash
    installer for MacOSX. After the download is complete, enter the following
    command in your terminal:
    <code>bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh</code>. Follow any prompts
    that arise during the install process. Once this is complete, the next thing
    you'll want to do is test whether the install worked by entering a
    <code>conda</code> command (e.g. <code>conda list</code>). If this produces
    an error, then there are a couple of possibilities as to why this may not
    have worked, most of which should be fixed after the next step.
</p>
<p>
    The next step is to check your shell config file, either <code>~/.bashrc</code>
    or <code>~/.zshrc</code>. Open this file in <code>nano</code> or your
    favorite graphical text editor. The Miniconda install process should have
    appended the following line to your "rc" file:
    <code>export PATH="~/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"</code>. This command prepends the
    path to the Miniconda functions to your system path environment variable. If
    this is not the case, then you should add this line manually, save your changes
    and reload your shell (open a new terminal window or source your "rc" file).

<h2 id="congrats">Congrats!</h2>
<p>
    You've completed Basic Setup. Time to move on to <a href="/advanced-setup.html">Advanced Setup</a>
    or go straight to learning more about the command line, shell scripting,
    and Python!
